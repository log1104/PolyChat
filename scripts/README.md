# Scripts

- `embed_bible.ts` *(todo)* – ingest Bible verses and embeddings into Supabase.
- `seed_dev.ts` *(todo)* – populate development accounts and conversations.

Scripts will be implemented as vertical slices progress. Refer to `Schema and Tool Specs.md` for the expected behaviour of each script.
